# ðŸ‘» Tic-Tac-Toe PVP
A iOS app PVP tic-tac-toe game. Using firebase and swift I created a PVP game. 

# Technologies
- Swift
- Firebase
- Xcode
- Google Authentication

# Why this app?
Creating a tic-tac-toe game is relatively easy, but I wanted to integrate a PVP aspect. I wanted to use this app as a stepping stone, to understand firebase, along with its synchronus capabilites. Features that are needed for a PVP game. 

# What can be improved?
In the future, I would like to implement a leaderboard. It would track wins, losses, along with who on all of the app is the best. 

# Screenshots
First I will add a link showing gameplay, along with adding, and recieving game and friend requets. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcHHGERHU9Q
